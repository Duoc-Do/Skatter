# Skatter
Currently a work in progress. I'd like Skatter to be a plugin with tools to assist with creating randomised patterns out of pre-determined shapes. 

## Random rotate
Select your layers and rotate them... randomly.

Shortcut key -> alt cmd R :boom: 

Todo:
  - add entropy handle

## Arrange skatter
Select the layers you'd like to Skatter and it will fill the artboard.

Shortcut key -> alt cmd A :tada:

Todo:
  - Better artboard support
  - Add UI to adjust entropy, spacing and rotation handles
